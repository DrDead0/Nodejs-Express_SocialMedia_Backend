# Social Media Backend

A basic social media backend developed with Node.js and Express, providing essential functionalities for building a social media application. Key features include user authentication, subscriptions, and post and video interactions, all stored and managed in MongoDB. Additional functionalities include password hashing with bcrypt, file uploads with multer, and pagination for video content using `mongooseAggregatePaginate`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your system.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) set up locally or via MongoDB Atlas.
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account for managing media storage.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DrDead0/Nodejs-Express_SocialMedia_Backend.git
    cd social-media-backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
    ```
    PORT=5230
    MONGODB_URI= your_mongodb_connection_string
    CORS_ORIGIN= your_cors_origin
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET= your_access_token_secret
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY= access_token_expiry (e.g., 1d)
    REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET= your_refresh_token_secret
    REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY= refresh_token_expiry (e.g., 7d)
    CLOUDINARY_NAME= your_cloudinary_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY= your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET= your_cloudinary_api_secret
    ```

4. **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    The server will be running at `http://localhost:5230`.
